# FizzBuzz-TDD

ABOUT THE PROJECT 
- The purpose of this project was to be an introduction to Test-driven development (TDD). 

- I followed a tutorial series by JeremyBytes found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4xhTq4qmC0&t=592s

- I used NUnit3 which was a more recent version of NUnit than shown in the video. I wasn't concened about using NUnit over another
  testing framework, as I'm more concerned with learning TDD concepts than a specific testing framework.
